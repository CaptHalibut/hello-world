#Platform Repository
This repository will focus on the creation of a VERY simple platform game - over time. 

This is a guaranteed boring github account and you should turn away immediately. 

The game will have the following features:
- Multiple Levels (Given)
- Different Enemy Types
- Different User Actions
  - Jumping
  - Double Jumping
  - Running
  - Spinning
  - Bouncing
  - Super Charging (Not like a Tesla)
 
- Different Crates / Boxes / Canisters to Open
- Different Platform Types

If you have any suggestions - please let us know! Somehow!
